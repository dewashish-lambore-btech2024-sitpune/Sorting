# ðŸ”„ Sorting in C++

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
To explore and develop **Sorting algorithms in C++**, encompassing **Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Bucket Sort**, while evaluating their performance metrics, complexity characteristics, and practical applications.

## ðŸ“š Theoretical Foundation  

Sorting involves organizing data elements in a specified sequence (ascending or descending). Effective sorting techniques are fundamental for enhancing search operations and streamlining data manipulation.

### ðŸ”‘ Essential Properties of Sorting Algorithms  
- **Stability**: Preserves the original sequence of equivalent elements.  
- **Memory Usage**: Distinction between in-place (minimal extra space) and out-of-place (requires additional memory).  
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluation across optimal, worst-case, and typical scenarios.  
- **Methodology**: Classification as comparison-based or non-comparison-based approaches.  

### ðŸ”„ Categories of Sorting Algorithms  

1. **Bubble Sort** â†’ Continuously exchanges neighboring elements when incorrectly ordered.  
2. **Selection Sort** â†’ Iteratively identifies the smallest element and positions it appropriately.  
3. **Insertion Sort** â†’ Constructs sorted sequence incrementally by placing each element in its proper location.  
4. **Merge Sort** â†’ Divide-and-conquer strategy that partitions array and combines sorted segments.  
5. **Quick Sort** â†’ Divide-and-conquer method that reorganizes elements around a pivot value.  
6. **Heap Sort** â†’ Constructs a max heap structure and systematically removes maximum elements.  
7. **Bucket Sort** â†’ Distributes elements across multiple buckets, sorts each independently, then merges. Performs optimally with uniformly distributed input.

## ðŸ“‹ Algorithms  

### ðŸ§¾ Bubble Sort  
1. Begin  
2. Accept array containing `n` elements.  
3. Execute for `i = 0` to `n-1`:  
   - Execute for `j = 0` to `n-i-2`:  
     - If `arr[j] > arr[j+1]`, exchange their positions.  
4. Terminate  

---

### ðŸ§¾ Selection Sort  
1. Begin  
2. Accept array containing `n` elements.  
3. Execute for `i = 0` to `n-1`:  
   - Initialize `minIndex = i`.  
   - Execute for `j = i+1` to `n-1`:  
     - If `arr[j] < arr[minIndex]`, set `minIndex = j`.  
   - Exchange `arr[i]` with `arr[minIndex]`.  
4. Terminate  

---

### ðŸ§¾ Insertion Sort  
1. Begin  
2. Accept array containing `n` elements.  
3. Execute for `i = 1` to `n-1`:  
   - Store `key = arr[i]`, initialize `j = i-1`.  
   - Repeat while `j >= 0` and `arr[j] > key`:  
     - Move `arr[j]` to position `arr[j+1]`.  
     - Decrease `j` by 1.  
   - Place `key` at position `arr[j+1]`.  
4. Terminate  

---

### ðŸ§¾ Merge Sort  
1. Begin  
2. If array contains multiple elements:  
   - Split array into two equal segments.  
   - Recursively apply sorting to both segments.  
   - Combine the two sorted segments.  
3. Terminate  

---

### ðŸ§¾ Quick Sort  
1. Begin  
2. If array contains multiple elements:  
   - Select a pivot element.  
   - Reorganize array into two partitions:  
     - Left partition: elements less than pivot.  
     - Right partition: elements greater than pivot.  
   - Recursively apply quick sort to both partitions.  
3. Terminate  

---

### ðŸ§¾ Heap Sort  
1. Begin  
2. Construct a max heap from the array elements.  
3. Execute until heap size reduces to 1:  
   - Exchange root (maximum element) with final element.  
   - Decrease heap size by 1.  
   - Restore heap property for root.  
4. Terminate  

---

### ðŸ§¾ Bucket Sort  
1. Begin  
2. Accept array containing `n` elements.  
3. Initialize `k` empty buckets.  
4. Assign elements to buckets using a distribution function (e.g., `bucket_index = value * k`).  
5. Sort each bucket independently (using insertion sort or alternative method).  
6. Merge all buckets sequentially to produce sorted array.  
7. Terminate
